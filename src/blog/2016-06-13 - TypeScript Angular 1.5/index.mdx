Recently I started wondering if it was possible to create an Angular 1.5 Component
that would look and act similar to an Angular 2 Component. The motive behind this
was fueled by the idea that if I could convert an existing Angular 1.5 code base
over to a more Angular 2 compliant syntax it would make adoption of Angular 2 significantly
easier. With that in mind I set out to make my TypeScript Angular 1.5 Component look
as similar to a Angular 2 Component as I could. What follows is my first pass at
beginning to make a wrapper that mirrors the Angular 2 syntax.

Consider the following piece of code written in JavaScript utilizing Angular 1.5

```javascript
(function () {
    'use strict';
    angular
        .module('app.home')
        .component('jigHome',
        {
            templateUrl: '/app/home/home.html',
            controller: homeCtrl,
            controllerAs: 'ctrl',
            bindings: {
                setup: '<'
            }
        });

    homeCtrl.$inject = [HomeService'];
    function homeCtrl(HomeService) {
        var ctrl = this;

        //ctrl.setup -- this is our bound property
    };
})();
```

To me this is as barebones of an example as one would need to prove out a concept.

- The component has a templateUrl
- The component has an inject parameter
- The component has a binding required from a routing resolution.

The first step towards making our Angular 1.5 Component appear similar to an Angular 2 Component
is to create a Component decorator that takes in similar parameters. For that we will leverage
ng.IComponentOptions from the Angular TypeScript definition file [angular.d.ts]

```typescript
function Component(
  moduleName: string,
  selector: string,
  options: ng.IComponentOptions
) {
  return (controller: Function) => {
    var mod = angular.module(moduleName);
    mod.component(
      selector,
      angular.extend(options, { controller: controller })
    );
  };
}
```

Unfortunately ng.IcomponentOptions does not have support for selector so I choose to leave this as
well as the module name as manually added string parameters.

The next step is to ensure that you have experimental TypeScript Decorators enabled

**tsconfig.json**

```json
//If you are using VS Code or have a tsconfig file, make sure this line is present.
"experimentalDecorators": true
```

**.NET**

```xml
//  -- if you are using .NET you will need to add this
//  -- add after TypeScriptTools in the first PropertyGroup tag

 <propertygroup>
    ....
    <typescripttoolsversion>1.8</typescripttoolsversion>
    <typescriptexperimentaldecorators>true</typescriptexperimentaldecorators>
 </propertygroup>
```

After the configuration changes are made you will be able to create your new decorated Component.
It's important to note that even though I named my exported class HomeComponent it is actually a
controller utilized by the component, however using this naming style lines up more closely with
the Angular 2 specification.

```typescript
@Component('app.home', 'jigHome', {
  templateUrl: '/app/home/home.html',
  controllerAs: 'ctrl',
  bindings: {
    setup: '<',
  },
})
export class HomeComponent {
  static $inject = ['HomeService'];
  setup: any;
  homeService: HomeService;

  constructor(homeService: HomeService) {
    this.$timeout = $timeout;
    this.homeService = homeService;
    //this.setup -- this is our bound property
  }
}
```

Let's see how this compares to it's Angular 2 counterpart

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'jig-home',
  templateUrl: '/app/home/home.html',
  providers: [HomeService],
})
export class HomeComponent {
  constructor(private homeService: HomeService) {}
  ngOnInit() {
    this.homeService.get();
  }
}
```

There is definitely a way to go before the signatures mirror however for 6 lines of code I feel
it's a terrific start. I'll keep fiddling with this throughout the week and hopefully release a
follow up with more compliant syntax.

For now, here are what I would deem the low hanging fruits.

- Create model for passing into @Component
- Move .\$inject call into the Providers array [will probably need to be sent as a string and injected into the controller on return]
- Wrap ng.ICOmponentOptions in the pass through model

UPDATE: I hgihly recommend checking out [ng-metadata](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata).
This project has come a long way and appears to be a serious implementation of Angular 2 syntax for Angular 1.
