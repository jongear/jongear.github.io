Form validation, every front-end developers favorite topic. Recently I have been migrating
form validation over to TypeScript and I have been pleasantly surprised by how clean TypeScript
Angular forms development is. Consider the following form example that allows a user to enter
a date into an input.

## TypeScript Angular Forms

**/app/my-component.component.html**

```html
<form name="$ctrl.myForm" ng-submit="$ctrl.submit()">
  <input
    type="text"
    id="txtStartDate"
    name="txtStartDate"
    required=""
    ng-model="$ctrl.startDate"
    ng-maxlength="10"
  />
  <div class="error" ng-messages="$ctrl.myForm.txtStartDate.$error">
    <span ng-message="required">
      Start Date is required.
    </span>
    <span ng-message="maxlength">
      Start Date must be less than 10 characters.
    </span>
  </div>

  <button type="button" ng-click="$ctrl.cancel()">Cancel</button>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

The above is a simple form with one input for a date, a submit and a cancel button.
There is some basic validation to ensure that the user submits a date that is no longer than ten characters.

**/app/my-component.component.ts**

```typescript
module MyModule {
  'use strict';

  export class MyComponent {
    model: any;
    myForm: ng.IFormController;
    startDate: string;

    static $inject = ['$state'];
    constructor(private $state: ng.ui.IStateService) {}

    cancel() {
      this.$state.go('root.home');
    }

    submit() {
      if (!this.myForm.$valid) return false;

      //form submit logic

      return true;
    }
  }

  angular.module('app').component(
    'my-component',
    angular.extend(
      {
        templateUrl: '/app/my-component.component.html',
        bindings: {
          model: '<',
        },
      },
      { controller: MyComponent }
    )
  );
}
```

What I enjoy most about using TypeScript for Angular forms is that I feel it really tries hard to step out
of your way. Other than listing the type of the form, the code is identical to writing javascript validation.
In the above example we have a simple form that ensures a user submits a value and it is at least 10 characters long.
Nothing crazy here. But what if we want to ensure that the value entered is after today. Since this is not a standard
validation we will need to create a custom validation to compensate.

## Custom Validation

Let's start by deciding on a value to show to our end user.

**/app/my-component.component.html**

```html
<input
  type="text"
  id="txtStartDate"
  name="txtStartDate"
  required=""
  ng-model="$ctrl.startDate"
  ng-maxlength="10"
/>
<div class="error" ng-messages="$ctrl.myForm.txtStartDate.$error">
  <span ng-message="required">
    Start Date is required.
  </span>
  <span ng-message="maxlength">
    Start Date must be less than 10 characters.
  </span>
  <span ng-message="beforeToday">
    Start Date must be after today.
  </span>
</div>
```

Notice how our input has not changed. We have simply added a new ng-message for warning users they cannot select a date before today.

**/app/my-component.component.ts**

```typescript
isValid(){
  var today = moment();
  var momentStartDate = moment(this.startDate, "MM/DD/YYYY");
  this.myForm["txtStartDate"].$error.beforeToday = momentStartDate < today;
}

submit(){
  this.isValid();

  if (!this.myForm.$valid) return false;

  //form submit logic

  return true;
}
```

And here is the logic to allow the component to raise our new error message. In this example I'm leveraging
[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to do a user text conversion for date comparison. If the user enters a value
that is not greater than today we throw our beforeToday error. Which will be caught when we attempt to check the form's validity.

And that about wraps up this segment. Check out the Angular documentation for more information about using the
[Angular FormController](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/form.FormController)
