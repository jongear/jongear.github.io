I have been doing a lot of wire framing over the past few weeks and thought I would
share some of the Lorem Ipsum alternatives I am using. If you are not familiar with
Lorem Ipsum it is a section of dummy text used to imitate user content in a design.

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. – lipsum.com

The following is a list of the best Lorem Ipsum alternatives I have found.

## [Zombie Ipsum](http://www.zombieipsum.com/)

If you’re looking for more BRAAIINS in your text filler.

## [Hacker Ipsum](http://hackeripsum.com/)

Hacker Ipsum has some quality nerd vernacular and offers more flexibility by allowing
for sentence per paragraph selection. They do limit max sentences and max paragraphs to
10 each so if you are looking for abnormally verbose text this will not be the text filler for you.

## [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/)

The meaty lorem ipsum. This generator offers meat, filler and even a spicy option. This generator is humorous
but a little limited in options.

## [Filerama](http://fillerama.io/)

Fillerama is great if you need filler text that also contains styling [bolding, listing, headers].
I love the nod to Futurama and Star Wars

## [Hodor Ipsum](http://hodoripsum.com/)

Who doesn’t love Hodor?

## [Trollem Ipsum](http://trollemipsum.appspot.com/)

Trollem Ipsum is great for trolling Apple/Android fanboy friends. It does use NSFW language so
keep that in mind before use.

## [Pirate Ipsum](https://pirateipsum.me/)

Pirate Ipsum definitely wins the best presentation award. The interface is clean and intuitive. They even sell posters.
