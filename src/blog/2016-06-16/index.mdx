[Earlier this week](/make-a-type-script-angular-1-5-component-look-like-a-angular-2-component) I spoke
to making a poor man’s TypeScript Component decorator to begin to make Angular 1.x syntax more Angular
2.x compliant. Since then one of my coworkers brought to my attention a phenomenal library that extends on
what I spoke to. ng-metadata is a library that allows you to wrap Angular 1.x code in TypeScript decorators
to give the appearance of Angular 2 code. This is a huge benefit because it will allow for more gradual
adoption of the Angular 2 specification.

This is a code snippet directly from ng-metadata that shows what your Angular 1.x Component code can be rewritten to look like

**Angular 1.x with ngMetadata and Typescript:**

```typescript
// bootstrap.ts
import { bootstrap } from 'ng-metadata/platform';
import { HeroModule } from './hero';

bootstrap(HeroModule);

// hero.ts
import * as angular from 'angular';
import { provide } from 'ng-metadata/core';
import { HeroComponent } from './hero.component';
import { HeroService } from './hero.service';

export const HeroModule = angular
  .module('hero', [])
  .directive(...provide(HeroComponent))
  .service(...provide(HeroService)).name;

// hero.service.ts
import { Injectable, Inject } from 'ng-metadata/core';

@Injectable()
export class HeroService {
  constructor(@Inject('$http') private $http: ng.IHttpService) {}
  fetchAll() {
    return this.$http.get('/api/heroes');
  }
}

// hero.component.ts
import { Component, Inject, Input, Output } from 'ng-metadata/core';
import { HeroService } from './hero.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'hero-cmp',
  templateUrl: 'hero.html',
  legacy: { transclude: true },
})
export class HeroComponent {
  @Input() name: string;
  @Output() onCall: Function;

  constructor(
    // we need to inject via @Inject because angular 1 doesn't give us proper types
    @Inject('$log') private $log: ng.ILogService,
    // here we are injecting by Type
    // which is possible thanks to reflect-metadata and Typescript and because our service
    // is defined as a class
    private heroSvc: HeroService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    /* your init logic */
  }
}
```

I have to admit, this is a very impressive port. The only real criticism I have of this
port is that it does not support Angular 2’s providers array in the Component decorator.

```typescript
// https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt4.html
// app/app.component.ts

@Component({
  providers: [HeroService],
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
  heroes: Hero[];
  selectedHero: Hero;

  constructor(private heroService: HeroService) {}
}
```

That being said I think that what the team at ng-metadata has done with the Inject decorator
is rather ingenious. I like that you can designate a service as @Injectable and forgo showing
any code in your @Component or you can opt for the more explicit route and use @Inject in the
constructor to make the DI function more obvious to the end developer.

[API docs](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata/blob/master/docs/API.md)

**UPDATE: 6/16/16**

I was incorrect. ng-metadata does have support for the providers array out of the box!

[ng-metadata — @Component](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata/blob/master/docs/API.md#component)

| Property       | DataType                       | Description                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **providers?** | Array<Injectables&#124;string> | Any providers that this component or any of it’s children depends on. This isn’t |
|                |                                | doing anything for now, just for visual experience and mirroring ng2 api         |
