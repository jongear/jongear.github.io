In this post we will discuss supporting Autocomplete with AWS CloudSearch. CloudSearch
is a full featured search engine that allows AWS users a performant way to query NoSQL
solutions via index columns. Read the following article if you would like to learn how to
port DynamoDB data to CloudSearch to follow along. Getting Started Searching DynamoDB Data
with Amazon CloudSearch

CloudSearch is a natural searching choice in the AWS world due to it’s ease of integration
with DynamoDB. In any searching solution there are a few common scenarios that users need to handle.

1. Autocomplete searching
2. Full text searching
3. Faceted searching

Today we will be focusing on the first scenario. We have a website that allows users to search
movies their favorite actors have starred in. This system will provide text autocomplete as users
spell out the name of their favorite actor.

Consider the following list.

| first_name | last_name | user_name  |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Jess       | Harnell   | Bingo4     |
| Jessie     | Ventura   | Orange7    |
| Jessica    | Biel      | Dachshund5 |
| Jesús      | Ochoa     | Apple3     |
| Tom        | Hardy     | Jester1    |
| Christine  | Jeston    | Carrot9    |

If our user types “jes” into our autocomplete search box to lookup their favorite actor by name they
expect to get back an autocomplete list of all actors that have “jes” contained somewhere within their
name. They do not expect to find Tom Hardy as his name does not contain a “jes” even though it is
part of his username.

```html
search?q=jes
```

The default query does phrase matching. Because of this we cannot approach solving autocomplete by using
the default syntax . The default query will return **0 results**, as none of our users have a single phrase
of “jes” contained in their user data. However, all of our desired users have “jes” as the prefix in a
desired column. We can use the \* wildcard character to specify any result that is prefixed by our desired search phrase.

```html
search?q=jes*
```

This seems to work on the surface, however, we are now receiving all results including Tom Hardy
(since his username contains jes as a prefix). To resolve this we need to limit the scope of our
prefix search to the first and last name fields only. This can be done by utilizing a structured query. For more information
on structured queries, [click here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/searching-compound-queries.html)

```html
search?q=(or (prefix field%3Dfirst_name 'jes') (prefix field%3Dlast_name 'jes'))
&q.parser=structured
```

_Note: In queries the = sign must be HTML encoded as %3D_
_Note: I have broken this request onto 4 separate lines to limit horizontal scrolling. It is one HTTP GET request_

This request will get all users with a prefix of “jes” but what happens if we add another “s” so that we are now searching for
“jess”? Well, since our user Jess Harnell does not have any continuing characters in their first name they will fail the
CloudSearch requirement and will not be returned. For this reason we will need to support searching for phrases
(as we did in our first example) as well as prefixes.

```html
search?q=(or (or (prefix field%3Dfirst_name 'jes') (phrase field%3Dfirst_name
'jes')) (or (prefix field%3Dlast_name 'jes') (phrase field%3Dlast_name 'jes')))
&q.parser=structured
```

The phrase syntax can be shorthanded to the following however I prefer the more explicit declaration

```html
search?q=(or (or (prefix field%3Dfirst_name 'jes') (or first_name: 'jes')) (or
(prefix field%3Dlast_name 'jes') (or last_name: 'jes'))) &q.parser=structured
```

By default, CloudSearch will return the top 10 results, which may be a little much for an autocomplete feature.
I personally prefer to show the top 5. This can be specified through the size parameter

```html
search?q=(or (or (prefix field%3Dfirst_name 'jes') (or first_name: 'jes')) (or
(prefix field%3Dlast_name 'jes') (or last_name: 'jes'))) &q.parser=structured
&size=5
```

Now we are able to get a smaller result set which will help to declutter the UI as the user continues typing to
narrow their search. If we do not provide a sort index or any scoring rules CloudSearch will attempt to score our
results for us. Which will rank results with phrase hits higher than prefix hits. If we decide we prefer our results
to be alphabetical regards of scoring, we can choose to apply a sort and a sort direction.

```html
search?q=(or (or (prefix field%3Dfirst_name 'jes') (or first_name: 'jes')) (or
(prefix field%3Dlast_name 'jes') (or last_name: 'jes'))) &q.parser=structured
&size=5 &sort=first_name asc
```
